            A long time ago the friends who just know their names of each other got become the friends who knows everything about ….its really strange. I know you since our intermediate but I never know we will be this good friends later. Firstly , I would say… you are such a brave and strongest woman I ever seen . You have consoled a lots of tears , despite you are drowning in the pool of tears . May be I should learn this from you. You will never believe this ..? how hard it was for me when you decided not to talk to me , offcourse you have all the right. I don’t know whether to say this or not .. When I asked you if I wouldn’t talk to you first , would you..? and you said straight No . It hurt me a lot and I didn’ t expected that.(felt like saying I’m sorry)
        </br>
    </br>
            I really had a great time with you and I still remember the day we talked eachother all night sharing a lot of things. I always used to think in my perspective , and I thought im comforting people but lately realized im not and learned to think from others side by the incident happened between us. I have learned a lot of things from you. I know you will get angry by reading the next line , but its okay . It was just a suggestion of mine never let your angry break your bonds.
</br>
</br>
            I’m really sorry if I ever hurt you and thank you for all the support you gave for me. I truly believe you will get a  great success in life and I wish you are this happy and kind always. I wish god to make our journey till the end of my life. I’m always there whenever you need .
</br>
</br>
            I never expressed things , that doesn’t mean I don’t care and I don’t miss you , I really do and I wish you to stay longer with us but somethings are never ours to hold. Your absence makes a lot of change in my life.
